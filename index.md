## Microwavin Manoa

Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines.

Microwavin Manoa creates a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes that:
* Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a toaster oven).
* Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
* Suit local taste sensibilities.
* Can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc).
* Have an estimated cost per serving.
* Has an estimated number of servings per recipe.
* Has an estimate of how long it takes to make.

* [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/microwavin-manoa) of Microwavin-Manoa containing all its repositories.

Technologies we plan on using for "Microwavin Manoa":

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.
